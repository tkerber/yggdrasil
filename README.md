## Not Asked Questions

Q: Why Idris?

A: Idris is both a dependently-typed programming language, and a theorem
prover, which comes with the territory of powerful type systems. The highly
generic type system allows yggdrasil to reason and prove statements about
highly generic protocols.

Q: Why AGPL?

A: AGPL is actually less strong than I'd like here, but stronger would be
unreasonable. I usually prefer permissive licenses, however it is crucial for
security protocols - and their implementation - to be available for public
scrutiny. If the use of AGPL results in one more protocol being made public, I
consider that a gain.
